## Installation

You will need to have node.js installed to your system and it will be accessible through the command line. Once installed, copy the SSH link by clicking into the repo in GitHub and clicking the green code button. Once you have the link copied, go to your command line and type git clone then paste the link after those words in the same line and the repo should be on your system. Use the cd command to enter the repo on your system then run npm i to install all packages needed to run the program.

## Usage

Once the repo is on your system, you will be able to run the command line from it. Traverse to the index.js file and start a new terminal from there. Type node index.js into your command line and you will be prompted to enter information about your project. Once completed a brand new README will be generated.
